                <p>My name is Sam Jeanlouie. I'm 16. I'm a sophomore at Watchung Hills Regional High School. I'm working towards<br> a bachelor in International Business and Biology. I'm also working towards a certificate in Web Design and Interface. <br>My goal in life is to be better. I'm not sure what that means yet, but I wanna be better. A better person. A happier <br>person. I can't predict what career I'll end up choosing or what life style. All I know is I wanna be a better person than I am right now.</p>

        <p>I'm still a fan, even though I was salty<br>
        Hate to see you with some other broad, now you happy<br>
        Hate to see you happy, if I'm not the one driving</p>
        I'm so mature, I'm so mature<br>
        I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men<br>
        I don't want none, I just want you<br>
        If I can't have you, no one should</p>
        I might<br>
        I might kill my ex, not the best idea<br>
        His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?<br>
        I might kill my ex, I still love him though<br>
        Rather be in jail than alone</p>
        I get the sense that it's a lost cause<br>
        I get the sense that you might really love her<br>
        This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence<br>
        I try to ration with you, no morals or crimes of passion, but damn</p>
        You was out of reach<br>
        You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach<br>
        Now I'm in the basement, planning home invasion<br>
        Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat</p>
        I'm so mature, I'm so mature<br>
        I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men<br>
        I don't want none, I just want you<br>
        If I can't have you, no one will</p>
        Uh (uh)<br>
        I might kill my ex, not the best idea<br>
        His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?<br>
        I might kill my ex, I still love him though<br>
        Rather be in jail than alone</p>
        I did it all for love (love)<br>
        I did it all on no drugs (drugs)<br>
        I did all of this sober<br>
        I did it all for us, oh</p>
        I did it all for love (love)<br>
        I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)<br>
        I did all of this sober<br>
        Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ex tonight)</p>
        Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)<br>
        Not the best idea (idea)<br>
        Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?<br>
        I just killed my ex (my ex)<br>
        I still love him, though (I do)<br>
